Context
The measurement of the power consumption alongside various other crucial operational metrics is performed at regular intervals of 900 seconds during the day and being able to estimate the dependency and correlation of power consumption on various operational metrics becomes an important use case to create and define boundary conditions for power requirements in periods of instantaneous spiking needs and keep our production operations robust with arrangements & pre-readiness.

This statement refers to a process where power consumption and other important operational metrics are measured every 900 seconds (15 minutes) throughout the day. The goal is to analyze the relationship between power consumption and these operational metrics. By understanding how power consumption depends on various factors, the organization aims to:

Content

1.Create Boundary Conditions: Establish limits for power consumption under different operational scenarios.

2.Prepare for Spikes: Ensure that there are strategies and resources in place to handle sudden increases in power demand.

3.Maintain Robust Operations: Keep production processes stable and efficient, even during unexpected changes in power needs.

Overall, this approach aims to optimize power usage, enhance readiness for power spikes, and ensure smooth production operations.
